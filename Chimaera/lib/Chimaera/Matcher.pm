=head1 NAME

Matcher - An object to look for Chimaeric (Bovine) MHC sequences

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.02

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.02';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

An object to check for possible chimaeric sequences in MHC sequencing studies.

Example usage....

    use Chimaera::Matcher;

    my $foo = Chimaera::Matcher->new( 'haplotype1' => $haplotype1, 'haplotype2' => $haplotype2);
    
    if ($foo->possible_chimaera($test_seq)) {
    	printf("Could be a chimaera\n");
    }
    else {
    	printf("Not a chimaera\n");
    }
    ...

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Given a pair of sequence strings, construct a Matcher that we can use
to test a series of possible chimaeric sequences against.

Two named sequence arguments must be supplied, keyed as 'haplotype1' and 'haplotype2'. Both must be the same length as each other and non-empty.

Tests are all case-insensitive.

	my $invocant = shift;
	my $class    = ref($invocant) || $invocant;
	my $self     = {@_};
	bless( $self, $class );
	foreach my $index ( 1, 2 ) {
		my $haplo = "haplotype${index}";
		throw Error::Simple( "No haplotype${haplo}" )
		  unless defined( $self->{$haplo} );
	}
	my $len = length($self->{'haplotype1'});
	throw Error::Simple( "Haplotypes differ in length" )
		unless ( $len == length($self->{'haplotype2'}));

	throw Error::Simple( "Haplotypes are empty" )
		unless ( $len > 0);
		
	$self->{'haplotype1'} = uc($self->{'haplotype1'});
	$self->{'haplotype2'} = uc($self->{'haplotype2'});

	my $matcher = {};
	for (my $i = 0; $i < $len; $i++) {
		my $base = {};
		$base->{substr($self->{'haplotype1'}, $i, 1 )} += 1;
		$base->{substr($self->{'haplotype2'}, $i, 1 )} -= 1;
		
		$matcher->{$i} = $base;

=head2 possible_chimaera

Pass in a sequence to be tested as a possible chimaera. The sequence must be the same
length as the haplotype arguments supplied in the constructor. If the test sequence has
a base that was not seen in either of the haplotypes supplied, then it cannot be a 
chimaera of the two. If the test sequence switches from one haplotype to the other more
than once, then this cannot be a chimaera.

	my %to_string = ( 0 => "", -1 => "A", 1 => "B");
	
	if ( length($candidate) != $self->{'length'} ) {
		return 0;
	}
	
	my $coded_string = "";
	for (my $i = 0; $i < $self->{'length'}; $i++) {
		my $base = substr($candidate, $i, 1);
